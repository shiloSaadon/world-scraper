Where do I start?\n\nThe coffee is roasted locally and is simply delicious. WayCup offers a range of changing single-origin coffee beans from around the world prepared in a range of brewing methods.\n\nThe owners and the baristas are some of the nicest and most friendly people around, in short, people who love what they do (coffee) and about their customers.\n\nWhether you are just stopping by for a quick coffee (it's literally 3 min walk from Rothschild Blvd.) or if you want to open a laptop and work there for the day, highly recommend this place.

The plan was to order, pay, \u0026 enjoy the coffee and cigarettes while sitting at the tables outside, \u0026 then heading off to begin the rest of my day...\n\nI ended up staying here for about 3 1/2 hours without even fully noticing (or caring)😋.\nThe coffee here is absolutely perfect \u0026 the prices are standard /average for a Tel Avivian coffee shop. But the thing that makes WayCup unique in my opinion is; a) the people here - (the workers as well as the customers), \u0026 b) how friendly they are...\n\nThe other customers I met while sitting at the table outside were so friendly and laid back, that my introverted, shy, \u0026 quiet self, ended up speaking to 3 different, random people who I've never met before \u0026 it felt completely natural.\n\nEach of the 3 people chose to sit right next to me - at the table directly next to mine. - these 3 people came separately \u0026 at different times obviously) and there was such a friendly vibe + straight up good conversations with random strangers.\n\nOne was an amazing artist who was drawing while drinking his coffee, the 2nd person is an employee at Facebook who was really interesting and cool to speak with, \u0026 the 3rd person was just a cool woman (I didn't ask what she does haha).\n\nAnyways I ended up ordering two more coffees because they were so delicious and I was thoroughly enjoying myself....\n\nSo from my original plan of a quick iced coffee + one little pastry before heading off, I had 3 coffees with the pastry and stayed for 3+hrs.\n\n*THE MAIN REASON I VISITED WAYCUP COFFEE IN THE FIRST PLACE*:\n\nThey're one of the VERY few places in Israel that sell Flat Whites (...if not the only one? - I honestly can't say for sure because l really haven't looked into it; but it's definitely the only coffee shop I've ever seen in Israel with Flat White on the menu).\n\nThe coffee is strong, fresh, \u0026 extremely tasty.\nIt's honestly addicting in a way that other coffees aren't.\n\nAll in all:\nA) Great service\nB) Great pastries\nC) Great atmosphere\nD) What else could you ask for?\n\nBy far one of the best Coffee Shops in this city.
