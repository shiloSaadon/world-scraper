this hipster spot regularly with the guys for quite some time now, and it never disappoints. Even though we may raise the average age a bit, the atmosphere is always lively, with a fun Ashdodi crowd adding to the vibe. The music is excellent, perfectly complementing the great food and drinks they offer. The service is always on point‚Äîfriendly and attentive. On top of that, the prices are affordable, making it a fantastic spot to unwind. Highly recommended!\n\nTip: If it‚Äôs your first time here, start with the Chibureki‚Äîit's a nostalgic dish from when the place was a small joint selling just that. What I usually go for (and it never disappoints) is the nuggets made in beer, fries with cheddar cheese, and the haloumi salad, which is quite big. We always pair it with a Franziskaner beer on tap.\n\nWe usually come on Thursdays around 21:30 when there are still plenty of tables available, but the place fills up fast as the night goes on. It's a good idea to either call ahead and reserve a table or arrive a bit earlier to secure a spot."",""Images"":null,""When"":""""},{""Name"":""Ran Arad"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUiL-s8WLKyIxSNVOIElBQRpC9Q675-SdP0Ghgv5EW3cZun-ALT=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""The music was much to loud, smoking was allowed everywhere, my ears are still ringing when I write this, and my hair smells of cigarettes.

Thankfully we had saved recorded audio of making reservations and finally we were sitted. We told about my birthday when reservation been made and also right away to our waitress.  I saw other people celebrating with waitstaff bringing them desert with sparklers and singing for them.  It looked like fun and I was expecting to have the same. We ordered food and were waiting for at least some glasses for water. Food was good,  portions are huge. We ordered khachapuri among the other dishes,  but it didn't arrive till almost the end of our dinner.  We thought it was forgotten and it would be OK, since we were full already,  but it arrived by the end. During the dinner we were hunting for waitstaff,  since nobody came to check on us. Another waiter came by and we again asked for a birthday special.  We ordered desert only for this reason.  And when another waiter brought desert, he just put it on the table and left.  No birthday song , no sparkle,  no nothing. I was so upset. And at same time we saw someone else is celebrating properly.  Finally our waitress showed up to bring our bill. We told her what happened,  she just looked surprised,  turned around and left. No apology at all, no care. I wouldn't even tip her, but tips already included in bill. We were so disappointed.

You don't get more friendly, welcoming and helpful than Merom, who greeted us when we walked into the informal check in area. ||||We had heard about Pina Barosh from others who had stayed there and it was everything we expected and more. Beautiful stone rooms and garden areas, photo-worthy and delicious breakfasts, a friendly staff, great music selections from a speaker on the terrace and the terrace itself where meals were served. Since dinner isn't served here since the pandemic, we just loved hanging out at the peaceful terrace at night listening to the music, looking out at the lights towards the Golan. ||||The bed and breakfast is located across from the Baron's Garden and the old city is a short walk uphill.
